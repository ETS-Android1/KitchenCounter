# KitchenCounter+
a team-oriented inventory, request, and order system for food service organizations. Using Android tablets, 
the entire kitchen team can use the KitchenCounter+ software to aggregate and automate the ordering process.
The software's main principle is that the traditional ordering process consists of three parts that answer
these three questions: "How much do we have?" (INVENTORY), "How much do we need?" (REQUEST), and, therefore, 
"How much do we need to order?" (ORDER). KitchenCounter+ allows each team member to add items to inventory 
and the requested products list. The order section consolidates all of the entries and allows the purchasing
manager to place orders and communicate the daily orders to the team via text or email.
